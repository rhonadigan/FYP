The aim of this project is to build a model that creates a more efficient traffic identification system for Dublin bikes. As I was only given the predictor variable, I used a combination of time series forecasting, clustering and data cleaning and preparation to build up a relevant dataset. After the dataset was ready I used advanced analytics and machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests and boosting models to predict bike demand at each stand throughout the day. I tested and compared multiple models and chose the one with the highest performance as the final model. The results showed that if implemented the system would result in a marked improvement in efficiency and cost.
